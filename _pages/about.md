Hello! I am a second-year PhD student at the [Carnegie Mellon University Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/), advised by [Professor Chris Atkeson](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~cga/). I work on getting robots to efficiently learn from observation and practice by leveraging human instruction. I am currently developing highly dynamic deformable object manipulation methods for tasks such as [flying knots](https://flying-knots.github.io/).

I graduated from Olin College of Engineering, where I studied Robotics. At Olin, I worked with [Professor Victoria Dean](https://vdean.github.io/) on developing modular robot manipulation policies and with [Professor Paul Ruvolo](https://www.olin.edu/bios/paul-ruvolo) on Visual-SLAM for indoor navigation to help blind/low-vision individuals.

I am passionate about all aspects of developing autonomous robot systems and have experience working with drones, manipulators, soft robots, mobile robots, and more (check out my project page for some examples!).
