  [f1afafea4bc6b348df7e5cdcc65ec8af34401857](https://github.com/krish-suresh/2016_V1_FTC_Code/commit/f1afafea4bc6b348df7e5cdcc65ec8af34401857) - a random sequence of numbers and letters alternatively known as a hash. This specific hash marks a special moment through my journey as an engineer, programmer and person. “f1afafe” is the hash associated with the first ever commit made almost 6 years ago and was labeled with the message “Initial commit.”  While my programming journey did not exactly start with a short-hash that nearly looks like falafel, it signifies both how much has changed but also how much is the same. I am now no longer running to catch the middle school bus, or programming on a Chromebook terminal during class. Yet, I am still crashing robots by programming the world upside down, struggling to plier off 3D-printed support filament, and making “Initial commits.” 

  I realize that I should probably introduce myself, so: Hi! I am Krishna Suresh, a rising sophomore at Olin College of Engineering studying Robotics. I am passionate about robotics and am looking to develop cooler and more intelligent robots that can hopefully one day empower people to live happier lives. This past year I took a plunge into the depths of Probabilistic Robotics, Visual Odometry/SLAM, and Controls as well as a shallower dip into Deep/Reinforcement Learning and Nonlinear Programming. I primarily spent time reading (albeit quite slowly) through Factor Graphs for Robot Perception, Controls Engineering in FRC, and various other papers to develop a basic understanding of the language and methodologies used in modern robotics. While I had hoped to apply some of the techniques in more projects, a lot of the learning culminated in these 1-2 week projects:

- [Particle Filter, RRT* and Pure Pursuit Navigation of a Robot Vacuum](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGzlZQ95yENrl-q4h6xQOG5QZb9IsN_YP)
- [Attempted Double Pendulum on a Cart Controlled by Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/krish-suresh/double-pendulum-rl)
- [UR5 Arms and CV Pipeline Used to Play the Game Perfection](https://github.com/krish-suresh/hiro-perfection-game/blob/main/README.md)

  Throughout middle and high school, I was drawn to and engrossed in building robots for the FIRST Tech Challenge robotics competition. I had grown an incredible amount in design and manufacturing through CAD, 3D printing and custom machined robots. But on the software theory side, I had only developed a basic understanding of path planning/following, PID Control, and computer vision. My abstract software knowledge was limited but simultaneously I was gaining valuable software design, architecture and debugging experience through writing thousands of lines of code each season. As I grew to learn more about the world of modern robotics controls and AI, I soon became overwhelmed by the almost insurmountable mountain of books, papers, and algorithms. But, since my goal remains to create more intelligent and capable robots, I hope to slowly but surely climb by building more projects to demonstrate solid understanding and serve as a launching point to future endeavors. 

  This post is my blog’s initial commit to kickoff documentation of adventures as I fall deeper into the rabbit hole on a quest to find the Wizard of Optimization. I hope to share my learning through both my successes and failures for anyone interested in the latest projects I’m working on but also for anyone interested in how I got there.
