QEA2 Final Project (2022) programming a NEATO robot vacuum to navigate through a room from a starting position to a target zone while avoiding obstacles like boxes and walls. The assignment featured escalating difficulty levels where navigational information was progressively removed to challenge implementation of localization and path-planning algorithms. Built in MATLAB.
