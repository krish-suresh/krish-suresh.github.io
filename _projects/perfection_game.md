Robotic manipulation project (Fall 2021) programming robotic arms to autonomously play the children's game Perfection. The robot picks up individual shapes using a gripper, then classifies and finds the orientation of each piece using an Intersection-Over-Union algorithm with OpenCV. Built with ROS, Python, OpenCV, and MoveIt.
